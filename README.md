# ScreenSaver
## How it works
*The program paints a black background first then paints a polygon circles one at a time.
*When the circles overlap then a loop p-icks a random color to fill the circle
*An array up to 1,000 circles is kept on screen.
*Once the array reaches its max capacity then the array is set to null. The screen is painted over getting rid of the circles.
